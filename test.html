        JS Introduction
      </header>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects

        Javascript and java
      </header>
      <p>
        JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript

          Variables
        </header>
        <p>
          You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
        </p>

          Declaring Variables
        </header>
        <p>
          You can declare a variable in three ways:
          With the keyword var. For example,
        <code>
          var x = 42.
        </code>
          By simply assigning it a value. For example,
        <code>
         x = 42.
       </code>
       This
        always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript
        warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the keyword let. For example,
        <code>
          let y = 13.
        </code>
        This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
        below.
        </p>
        <p>
          This syntax can be used to  declare both local and global variables.
        </p>

        Constants
        </header>
        <p>
         you can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
       </p>
       <code>
        const PI = 3.14;
       </code>
       <p>
       You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
       variable in the same scope. For example:
       </p>
      <code>
       // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
       CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements}
       </code>
     <code>
       const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";
     </code>

         Datatypes
       </header>
       <p>
         The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types.
         Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.
